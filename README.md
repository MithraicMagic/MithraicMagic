#### Hi there, I’m Nick! 👋🏼

I'm a software engineer at Prodrive Technologies that just got his bachelor for IT & Software Engineering.  
I ❤️ working with JS, C#, Java and a bit of C++, and am currently dipping my toes into functional programming (for now just Elm and F#).

There's quite a few projects that I've worked on over the years, a couple for school, a couple in my free time and a couple for some side jobs.
I'd still love to collaborate on some (open-source) projects with some people and help make some tools and apps better!

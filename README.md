#### Hi there, I’m Nick! 👋🏼

I'm a software engineer at Prodrive Technologies.  
I ❤️ working with TypeScript, C#/F# and Elm. You can usually find me working on the frontend.

There's quite a few projects that I've worked on over the years, a couple for school, a couple in my free time and a couple for some side jobs.
I'd still love to collaborate on some (open-source) projects with people and help make some tools and apps better!
